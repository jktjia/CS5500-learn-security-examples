Anyone could pretend they were admin if they found the id for admin because there's nothing checking that
the session is associated with the id for admin. The more secure version checks the session's userId is the
same as that of the request body. This is still vulnerable to spoofing, so the security could be improved 
by making the cookie http only and same site only.
