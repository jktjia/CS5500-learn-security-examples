- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Events are simply logged in the console in the insecure version, and nothing is logged when something goes wrong, so it's 
hard to track where and when an attack was made or something went wrong. The secure version logs all requests and errors,
along with when they happened in a separate file on the server end. This could be improved by having only allowing certain users
to access server.log so it can't be tampered with.
